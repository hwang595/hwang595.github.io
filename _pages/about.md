    <h3>Background</h3>
    <p>
      I was a Senior Project Scientist at the
      <a href="https://www.ml.cmu.edu/">Machine Learning Department at CMU</a>,
      working with <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~epxing/">Eric Xing</a>.
      I obtained my PhD in Computer Science from
      <a href="https://www.cs.wisc.edu/">UW-Madison</a>, advised by
      <a href="http://papail.io/">Dimitris Papailiopoulos</a>.

    <h3>Current Focus</h3>
    <p>
      I study efficient training and serving of large-scale machine learning models,
      especially large language models under real system constraints.
