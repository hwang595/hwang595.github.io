Biography
======
**I will join** [Rutgers CS Department](https://www.cs.rutgers.edu/) **in summer 2025 as a tenure-track Assistant Professor**. **And I'm actively looking for highly self-motivated Ph.D. students and postdocs!** 

I am a Senior Project Scientist at [the Machine Learning Department at CMU](https://www.ml.cmu.edu/) working with [Eric Xing](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~epxing/). I obtained my Ph.D. from [CS at the UWisconsin-Madison](https://www.cs.wisc.edu/), advised by [Dimitris Papailiopoulos](http://papail.io/).   

My research studies the scalability and efficiency of machine learning algorithms and systems (especially for LLMs now). Here a copy of my [CV](https://hwang595.github.io/cv/hwang_cv.pdf).   

## News
* I received the the [Rising Star Award of the 2024 CPAL Conference](https://cpal.cc/rising_stars_awardees/)!  

## Open-source Projects
* [LLM360](https://www.llm360.ai/): An initiative to fully open-source LLMs, which advocates for all training code and data, model checkpoints, and intermediate results to be made available.

## Grants
* NSF IIS2311990 (Senior Personnel/Co-Investigator, PI: Eric P. Xing) "III: Small: Multiple Device Collaborative Learning in Real Heterogeneous and Dynamic Environments", 09/01/2023-08/31/2026.  
* Semiconductor Research Corp. Artificial Intelligence Hardware Program (Project Co-lead, PI: Eric P. Xing) "Co-designing Distributed ML Systems and Algorithms for Foundation Models for AI-for-Science", 01/01/2024-12/31/2026.
