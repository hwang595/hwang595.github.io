Biography
======
I am a Postdoctoral Fellow at [the Machine Learning Department at CMU](https://www.ml.cmu.edu/) and a member of [the SAILING Lab](https://sailing-lab.github.io/) working with [Eric Xing](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~epxing/) on machine learning and systems.


I obtained my Ph.D. degree from the [Computer Sciences Department](https://www.cs.wisc.edu/) at University of Wisconsin - Madison, advised by [Dimitris Papailiopoulos](http://papail.io/). In Madison, I worked closely with [Shivaram Venkataraman](http://shivaram.org/), [Kangwook Lee](http://kangwooklee.com/), and [Theodoros Rekatsinas](http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~thodrek/).

My research studies the efficiency of machine learning algorithms and systems. I am also broadly interested in federated learning, including, but not limited to its communcation, memory efficiency, and robustness.
