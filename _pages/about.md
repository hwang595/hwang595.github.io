Biography
======
I am a Senior Project Scientist at [the Machine Learning Department at CMU](https://www.ml.cmu.edu/) and a member of [the SAILING Lab](https://sailing-lab.github.io/) working with [Eric Xing](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~epxing/) on machine learning and systems.  

I obtained my Ph.D. degree from the [Computer Sciences Department](https://www.cs.wisc.edu/) at University of Wisconsin - Madison, advised by [Dimitris Papailiopoulos](http://papail.io/).

My research studies the scalability and efficiency of machine learning algorithms and systems.
