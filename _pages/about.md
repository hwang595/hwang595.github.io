Biography
======
I'm joining the [The Machine Learning Department at Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.ml.cmu.edu/) as a Postdoctoral Fellow working with [Prof. Eric Xing](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~epxing/) on machine learning and systems.


I recently graduated from the [Computer Sciences Department](https://www.cs.wisc.edu/) at University of Wisconsin - Madison, advised by [Prof. Dimitris Papailiopoulos](http://papail.io/). It was very fortunate to work closely with [Prof. Shivaram Venkataraman](http://shivaram.org/), [Prof. Kangwook Lee](http://kangwooklee.com/), and [Prof. Theodoros Rekatsinas](http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~thodrek/).  
My research studies the scalability and robustness of distributed machine learning applications e.g. [Federated Learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federated_learning). I also spend time in industry serving as interns at [Microsoft Research](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/) and [IBM Research](https://www.research.ibm.com/labs/cambridge/).
