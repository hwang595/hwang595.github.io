Biography
======
I a tenure-track Assistant Professor at [The CS Department at Rutgers University](https://www.cs.rutgers.edu/). 

I was a Senior Project Scientist at the [ML Department at CMU](https://www.ml.cmu.edu/) working with [Eric Xing](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~epxing/). I obtained my PhD from [CS at the UW-Madison](https://www.cs.wisc.edu/), advised by [Dimitris Papailiopoulos](http://papail.io/).  

My research studies the scalability and efficiency of machine learning algorithms and systems (especially for LLMs now). Here a copy of my [CV](https://hwang595.github.io/cv/hwang_cv.pdf).   

## News
* Our work [RedCoast](https://aclanthology.org/2024.naacl-demo.14/) won the NAACL 2024 Best Demo Paper Runner Up!
* I received the the [Rising Star Award of the 2024 CPAL Conference](https://cpal.cc/rising_stars_awardees/)!  

<!-- ## Open-source Projects
* [LLM360](https://www.llm360.ai/): An initiative to fully open-source LLMs, which advocates for all training code and data, model checkpoints, and intermediate results to be made available.
* [AIDO](https://huggingface.co/genbio-ai): A system of multiscale foundation models for predicting, simulating, and programming biology at all levels. -->

<!-- ## Grants
